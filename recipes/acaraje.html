    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In Bahia, the northeastern state of Brazil, there is a dish that is considered to be the most popular street food around, called acarajé. It consists of peeled beans or black-eyed peas that are formed into a ball, deep-fried in dendé palm oil, split in half, then stuffed with flavorful, spicy pastes made from numerous ingredients such as cashews, palm oil, and shrimp.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces dry black-eyed peas</li>
        <li>2 onions, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 pound shrimp, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>4 cups coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>2 1/2 ounces cashews</li>
        <li>1 cup manioc flour, toasted</li>
        <li>Grated ginger, to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups dendê oil (palm oil), plus more for seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 onion with peel</li>
        <li>Salsa, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, add the peas and process until coarse. Transfer to a bowl and cover with cold water. The skins will float to the top; scoop them out and discard. Allow peas to soak for 8 hours. Drain the water.</li>
        <li>In the food processor, add the soaked peas and half the chopped onion. Blend until it turns into a paste.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a large mixing bowl; season with salt and mix with a wooden spoon until the volume doubles.</li>
        <li>In a blender, add the shrimp, coconut milk, peanuts, cashews, remaining chopped onion, manioc flour and ginger. Blend until well combined, then transfer to a pan. Season with salt. Cook mixture over medium heat, stirring so it doesn't thicken. Add some drops of palm oil, just enough to give it color and flavor. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a deep-sided pan, add palm oil. Place the half onion in the pan to gauge cooking temperature. Place spoonfuls of the shrimp mixture in the oil, and let it fry until it's golden on both sides.</li>
        <li>Remove from oil and allow to cool slightly. Slice in half; stuff with pea mixture, salsa and shrimp.</li>
    </ol>
